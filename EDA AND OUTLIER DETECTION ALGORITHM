1. Data Preprocessing
Before detecting outliers, we should clean and prepare the data:

Handle Missing Data: Check for any missing values and decide whether to fill them with appropriate statistics (mean, median) or remove the rows/columns.

Data Types: Verify the data types of each column (categorical, numerical) and encode them appropriately if necessary.

Feature Engineering: Create new features if applicable, based on business understanding.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps us understand the distribution of the data, which is essential for detecting outliers.

Univariate Analysis: Visualize each feature independently to check for outliers in terms of extreme values using boxplots, histograms, etc.

Multivariate Analysis: Check relationships between features using scatter plots, pair plots, etc., and detect multivariate outliers (e.g., through correlation analysis).

Summary Statistics: Use mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range (IQR) to get a sense of typical value ranges.

3. Outlier Detection Methods
There are multiple techniques to detect outliers in a dataset. The most common ones include:

a) Statistical Methods
Z-Score: A standard method for detecting outliers by comparing the number of standard deviations an observation is from the mean.

For each feature, calculate the Z-score:

𝑍
=
𝑋
−
𝜇
𝜎
Z= 
σ
X−μ
​
 
Where 
𝑋
X is the data point, 
𝜇
μ is the mean, and 
𝜎
σ is the standard deviation.

If the Z-score is greater than a threshold (commonly 3 or -3), it's considered an outlier.

IQR (Interquartile Range) Method: This method identifies outliers as values that lie outside the range defined by the lower and upper bounds of the IQR (i.e., Q1 - 1.5 * IQR and Q3 + 1.5 * IQR).

Where Q1 and Q3 are the 25th and 75th percentiles of the data.

Outliers are typically values that lie below 
𝑄
1
−
1.5
×
𝐼
𝑄
𝑅
Q1−1.5×IQR or above 
𝑄
3
+
1.5
×
𝐼
𝑄
𝑅
Q3+1.5×IQR.

b) Machine Learning Methods
Isolation Forest: A tree-based model specifically designed for outlier detection.

Local Outlier Factor (LOF): Measures the local density deviation of a data point with respect to its neighbors.

DBSCAN: A density-based spatial clustering algorithm that can also be used for outlier detection.

c) Visualization-Based Methods
Boxplots: A simple way to detect outliers in one-dimensional data.

Pairplot/Heatmap: Used for multivariate data to identify any correlations or unusual relationships.

4. Implementation in Python
We can implement the above methods using Python. Here's an example of how you might perform an initial EDA and use IQR and Z-Score for outlier detection:

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats

# Load your data
# df = pd.read_csv("your_data.csv")

# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Descriptive statistics
print(df.describe())

# Univariate Analysis (Visualize each numerical feature)
numerical_columns = df.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64']).columns
for col in numerical_columns:
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    sns.boxplot(x=df[col])
    plt.title(f"Boxplot of {col}")
    plt.show()

# Outlier Detection using Z-Score
z_scores = np.abs(stats.zscore(df[numerical_columns]))
outliers_zscore = (z_scores > 3).all(axis=1)  # Rows where all features have a Z-score > 3

# Outlier Detection using IQR
Q1 = df[numerical_columns].quantile(0.25)
Q3 = df[numerical_columns].quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
outliers_iqr = ((df[numerical_columns] < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) | (df[numerical_columns] > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))).any(axis=1)

# Combining outlier results
df['outliers_zscore'] = outliers_zscore
df['outliers_iqr'] = outliers_iqr

# Viewing rows with outliers based on Z-Score or IQR
print(df[df['outliers_zscore'] | df['outliers_iqr']])

# Visualize outliers using pairplot or heatmap (optional for multivariate outliers)
sns.pairplot(df[numerical_columns])
plt.show() 

from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Initialize the model
iso_forest = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05)  # 5% of the data are outliers
outliers_iso = iso_forest.fit_predict(df[numerical_columns])

# Mark outliers in the dataset
df['outliers_iso'] = outliers_iso == -1  # -1 means outlier, 1 means inlier

# Check the rows with outliers
print(df[df['outliers_iso']])
